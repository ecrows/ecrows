### Hi there, I'm Evan! 👋🏳️‍🌈🇨🇦

(he/him/they/them)

I'm a software engineer from up north!  I'm into ML model serving, applied research, and AI ethics.

I currently work for the Government of Canada.  You can read about my professional work over on my website, [https://ecrows.ai](https://ecrows.ai).  I'm also a PhD student at the University of Ottawa, where I do machine learning research.

I enjoy foreign films, play the fiddle, and avidly follow the StarCraft II pro scene.  I speak English, un peu françis canadien, 和一点中文.  I draw and make indie games as a hobby -- a couple of which have millions of YouTube views after being played by high-profile streamers (which is still hard for me to believe!)

### What I'm up to right now

My PhD research focuses on effective and ethically rigorous solutions to detection of online influence campaigns using Transformer language models.  Much of my professional work has been application-oriented data science, converting cutting-edge research into real-world systems, with a strong skew towards ethics and security.   I have a soft spot for generative AI, and have spent a long time messing around with GPT-2 and StyleGAN in my spare time.  I've have had the privilege of working with some ludicrous hardware thanks to the super-awesome TensorFlow Research Cloud program, [including a 1.5B parameter Chinese song lyric generator built on GPT-2](https://twitter.com/ecrws/status/1246291482782437381/photo/1), and hundreds of BERT embedding classifiers as part of an extensive study of [algorithmic bias in Transformer-based OIC detection systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11030).

### Collaboration!

I'm looking to collaborate on...
- 🍣 Cross-platform ML infrastructure for improving developer experience (shout-out to [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML))
- ⚖️ AI ethics, explainability, and data-driven policy
- ✅ Getting people to actually read machine learning model documentation with [Open Model Cards](https://github.com/ecrows/open-model-cards)
- 🎨 Beautiful generative art projects, and tools that give artists new superpowers

Feel free to ask me about anything I've worked on, and also let me know what projects motivate you.
