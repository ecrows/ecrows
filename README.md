### Hi there, I'm Evan! 👋🏳️‍🌈🇨🇦

(he/him)

I'm a software engineer from up north!  I'm into ML model serving, applied research, and AI ethics.  You can also read about my professional and academic work over on my website, [https://ecrows.ai](https://ecrows.ai).

I enjoy foreign films, play the fiddle, and avidly follow the StarCraft II pro scene.  I speak English, un peu français canadien, 和一点中文.  Finally, I also draw and develop indie games as a hobby -- some of which you may have heard of!

### Collaboration!

I'm looking to collaborate on...
- 🍣 Cross-platform ML infrastructure for improving developer experience (shout-out to [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML))
- ⚖️ AI ethics, explainability, and data-driven policy
- 🎨 Beautiful generative art projects, and tools that give artists new superpowers

Feel free to ask me about anything I've worked on, and let me know what projects motivate you!
