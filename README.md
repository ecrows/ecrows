### Hi there, I'm Evan! 👋🏳️‍🌈🇨🇦

(he/him/they/them)

I'm a software engineer from up north!  I'm into ML model serving, applied research, and AI ethics.

I currently work for the Government of Canada.  You can read about my professional work over on my website, [https://ecrows.ai](https://ecrows.ai).  I'm also a PhD student at the University of Ottawa, where I do machine learning research.

I enjoy foreign films, play the fiddle, and avidly follow the StarCraft II pro scene.  I speak English, un peu françis canadien, 和一点中文.  I draw and make indie games as a hobby -- some of which you may have heard of!

### Collaboration!

I'm looking to collaborate on...
- 🍣 Cross-platform ML infrastructure for improving developer experience (shout-out to [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML))
- ⚖️ AI ethics, explainability, and data-driven policy
- ✅ Getting people to actually read machine learning model documentation with [Open Model Cards](https://github.com/ecrows/open-model-cards)
- 🎨 Beautiful generative art projects, and tools that give artists new superpowers

Feel free to ask me about anything I've worked on, and also let me know what projects motivate you.
